# BMI CALCULATOR
-----------------



### Reference
------------

Your **BMI** is a measurement of your body weight based on your *height* and *weight*. Although your BMI does not actually "measure" your percentage of body fat, it is a useful tool to estimate a healthy body weight based on your height. Due to its ease of measurement and calculation, it is the most widely used diagnostic indicator to identify a person's optimal weight depending on his height. Your BMI "number" will inform you if you are **underweight**, of **normal weight**, **overweight**, or **obese**. However, due to the wide variety of body types, the distribution of *muscle* and *bone mass*, etc., it is not appropriate to use this as the only or final indication for diagnosis


### Calculation working formula
------------------------------

The formulas to calculate BMI based on two of the most commonly used unit systems:

BMI = weight(kg)/height2(m^2)         (Metric Units)
BMI = 703*weight(lb)/height2(in^2)         (U.S. Units)
